Neural network library for natural language processing, implemented in F#. This library was used to obtain results in following papers:

* [Tarasov D.S. (2015) Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Multiple Language Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis // Computational Linguistics and Intellectual Technologies: Proceedings of Annual International Conference “Dialogue”, Issue 14(21), V.2, pp. 65-74](http://www.meanotek.ru/files/TarasovDS2015-Dialogue.pdf)
* [Tarasov D.S. (2015) Natural Language Generation, Paraphrasing and Summarization of User Reviews with Recurrent Neural Networks // Computational Linguistics and Intellectual Technologies: Proceedings of Annual International Conference “Dialogue”, Issue 14(21), V.1, pp. 571-579](http://www.meanotek.ru/files/natgen.pdf)

Some features:

* Feedforward neural networks
* Uni and bi-directional multi-layer reccurrent networks
* Support for sequential and graph-based layer connectivity
* Sigmoid, Tanh, RelU and Softmax activations
* Dropout
* Projection layer for word embeddings
* Gaussian noise layer
* Runs under .NET Framework and mono runtime
* 1D convolutional layers and k-max pooling layers for text processing
